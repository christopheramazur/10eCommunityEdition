#T’AU EMPIRE
##ARMY RULE
###VALKYRIE'S MARK
[i]When the Fire Caste wages war, its warriors are not organized in the disciplined regiments of the Imperium, nor the sterile ranks of the soulless Necrons, or the ragtag warbands of the bloodthirsty Orks. Instead, its Cadres are organized around specific goals, pulling from tight-knit groups of blood-bonded Fire Warriors and stand-out specialists to create a self-sufficient cell, whose purpose is wholly bent to the completion of their objective. An individual Cadre is commonly organized around a small number of Shas'vre who each lead the individual groups it's composed of. These Cadres are further directed by Shas'el, veterans in both the Philosophies of War and the study of their myriad enemies. With the tactical application of each Cadre assured, it falls to the Commanders of the T'au war machine to direct the grand strategy of the myriad Cadres, like the wind behind a sail. And tying it all together, from the newest drone fresh from the factory, to the mightiest Commander, is the Markerlight.

The Markerlight is, like many T'au inspirations, deceptively simple in its presentation. The devices themselves resemble simple rangefinders, but advances in drone and AI technology have augmented them beyond appearances. Multispectrum lidars mounted in a stabilizing frame actively counteract disturbance and movement from the user, and compensate for movement from the target. AI helps identify cloaked or concealed targets, and to analyze the structure and composition of whatever the Markerlight is pointed at. The tactical uplink provides all of this, as well as telemetry data and other tactical feed, directly to the Cadre's HUDs, complete with target prioritization that any warrior can augment themselves on the fly with their own observations. 

If that were all, it would be a useful tool for squad operations and little more. However, this data is all routed through the T'au Tactical Drone network, where AI and Cadre Command are further able to gather, sort, and disseminate relevant information instantaneously across the battlefront. Troop movements and logistics trails become visible in real time, priority targets are highlighted with suggestions of orders filed immediately to approve or deny, millions of robotic minds aiding the Commanders to shape order from chaos.

The Markerlight is the lens through which the T'au focus their might; it guides the Fire Caste to the T'au'va, and through it, to victory.[/i]

If your Army Faction is T'au Empire, when a unit from your army with this rule selects targets to shoot, if it is not a Hunter, you may have it hunt a single one of those targets. Until the end of the battle the shooting unit becomes a Hunter and the target becomes its Prey. Select any number of other units from your army with this rule that have visibility to that Prey. Those units become Spotters for that Prey. Prey may have any number of Hunters and Spotters, but each Hunter and Spotter can only have one Prey at a time.

- A Hunter is only a Hunter for its own Prey, and a Spotter is only a Spotter for its own Prey.
- A Hunter may not be a Spotter, and a Spotter may not be a Hunter. 
- If a Prey is destroyed, embarks on a transport, or is removed from the battlefield, it is no longer Prey. 
- If a Prey has no Hunters, or has no Spotters, it is no longer Prey.
- If a Hunter or Spotter has no Prey, it is no longer a Hunter or Spotter. 

When a Prey is shot by its Hunter, each of that Prey's Spotters within 24" and that it is visible to contribute a number of Markerlight tokens equal to the number shown in their ability (e.g. a Spotter with the Markerlights 2 ability would contribute 2 Markerlight tokens). Then, select any number of distinct Markerlights effects whose total cost is less than or equal to the number of Markerlight tokens that were contributed. The selected Markerlights effects are applied while the Hunter resolves its attacks against the Prey this phase. Any unused Markerlight tokens are lost.

####Markerlights Effects

#####Fire for Suppression
Cost: 2 Markerlight Tokens
Just after the Guided unit finishes its shooting against the Marked unit, if one or more of those attacks scored a Hit the Marked unit must take a Battle Shock test.

#####Strip Cover
Cost: 2 Markerlight Token
The Marked unit loses and cannot gain the benefits of cover against the Guided unit's attacks.

#####Precision Telemetry
Cost: 3 Markerlight Tokens
Increase the Ballistics skill by 1 for the Guided unit's ranged weapons which target the Marked unit. 

#####Paint the Target
Cost: 4 Markerlight Tokens
Contribute 4 Markerlight Tokens to the next Hunter 

#####Guided Fusillade
Cost: 4 Markerlight Tokens
Each time the Guided unit makes a ranged attack against the Marked unit, it may re-roll a hit roll of 1.

#####Structural Analysis
Cost: 4 Markerlight Tokens
Each time the Guided unit makes a ranged attack against the Marked unit, it may re-roll a wound roll of 1.

#####Target Priority Override
Cost: 5 Markerlight Tokens
The Guided unit's ranged attacks hit on unmodified Hit rolls of 4+ during Overwatch against the Marked unit.


##T’AU EMPIRE – PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
###DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, you can use this PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule.

####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
At the start of the first battle round, before the start of the first player turn, you may select up to 3 units from your army and redeploy them. When doing so those units can be placed into Strategic Reserve, ignoring normal limitations. 

Units from your army cannot be destroyed while they are in reserves until the end of the fifth Battle Round. Beginning from the fourth Battle Round, reserves units from your army that are set up wholly within 6" of a battlefield edge ignore the normal restrictions on how close they may be set up to enemy units, and can be set up wholly outside of 3" from enemy units instead. 

Units from your army that are on the battlefield at the beginning of the first Battle Round gain Scouts 6" and their weapons gain the [ASSAULT] ability until the end of the first turn in which you deploy a reserves unit.


##T’AU EMPIRE – PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
###STRATAGEMS
If you are using the PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule, you can use these PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Stratagems.

####STIMULANT INJECTORS - 1CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
WHEN: Just after a Battlesuit unit from your army suffers one or more unsaved wounds.
TARGET: That T’au Empire Battlesuit unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, models in the target unit gain Feel No Pain 6+.

####STRIKE AND FADE - 1CP/2CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Battlesuit unit from your army that can Fly whose attacks have been resolved this phase.
EFFECT: If that unit is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can make a Normal move. If it does, that unit cannot declare a charge this turn. This Strategem costs 1CP if it targets a unit with 3 or fewer models. Otherwise, it costs 2CP.

####KILLING BLOW - 1CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
WHEN: The start of your Movement phase
TARGET: One or two units from your army with Scouts.
EFFECT: Each time one of those units Advances this turn, do not make an Advance roll for it. Instead, until the end of the phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic of models in that unit.

####PATIENT HUNTERS - 1CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
WHEN: The Reinforcements step of your Movement phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Infantry unit from your army that is in Reserves.
Effect: Instead of setting up normally, that unit may be set up wholly within 9" and wholly outside of 3" of one or more enemy units within range of an Objective, respecting all other range restrictions on its deployment as normal.
RESTRICTIONS: Until the end of the turn, that unit may only select units within range of Objectives as targets for their attacks, and may not declare a charge.

####REPEL THE ENEMY - 1CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just after an enemy unit has declared a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Grenades or Battlesuit unit from your army that was selected as one of the targets of that charge.
EFFECT: That enemy unit must immediately take a Battle-shock test. Subtract 2 from Charge rolls made for that enemy unit until the end of the phase.

####THERE IS YOUR PREY, SHAS'LA! - 2CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just after resolving the Fire Overwatch Stratagem.
TARGET: One unit from your army that is within 24" of that charging unit and can see it.
EFFECT: That unit immediately shoots the charging unit as if resolving the Fire Overwatch Stratagem.
RESTRICTIONS: The unit resolving the initial Fire Overwatch Stratagem must be a Spotter of the charging unit. The target of this Stratagem must be a Hunter of the charging unit.

##T'AU EMPIRE - PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
### ENHANCEMENTS
If you are using the PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule, you can use these PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Enhancements.

####EXEMPLAR OF THE KAUYON
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
At the end of each of your opponent's turns, if the bearer's unit is wholly within 9" of a battlefield edge you may place it into Strategic Reserve. You may only do this once per battlefield edge.

####EXEMPLAR OF THE MONT'KA
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
Add 1 to the OC of models in the bearer's unit until the end of your next Command phase whenever the bearer ends an Advance move in range of an Objective that one or more enemy units is also in range of. 

####PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
Once per turn, if you would use a Stratagem that targets a unit within 6" of the bearer, roll a D6. On a result of 4+ you may subtract 1 from that Stratagem's CP cost to a minimum of 0.

####PRECISION OF THE PATIENT HUNTER
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
The bearer's weapons gain Precision. If any of the bearer's weapons already had Precision, attacks with those weapons gain +1 to Hit rolls and +1 to Wound rolls against Character units.

##T’AU EMPIRE
###DRONES

####GUARDIAN DRONE
Each time a model makes a ranged attack that targets the bearer’s unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.

####MARKER DRONE
Add 1 to the total number of Markerlight tokens contributed to the bearer's Prey.

####MISSILE DRONE
The bearer is equipped with the following ranged weapon:
RANGED WEAPON       RANGE   A   BS  S   AP  D   RULES
Missile pod         36"     2   5+  7   -2  2   [HEAVY]

GHOSTKEEL BATTLESUIT
Nothing so huge should be able to slip unnoticed across the
battlefield, yet between its stealth field and its electronic warfare
suite the Ghostkeel Battlesuit does just that. Once in position its pilot
unleashes ferocious volleys of firepower, ambushing, overwhelming
and scattering the terrified foe in a matter of moments.

Hidden behind shimmering stealth fields, the Firesight Marksmen
play their targeting instruments over the foe and transmit data to the
MV71 Sniper Drones in their thrall. In this way they augment the fireprioritisation routines of the drones’ artificial intelligences, rendering
them smarter, more cunning and even more deadly to distant foes.

drones can optimise the team’s pulse fire or drive the enemy back with
gravitic waves. Yet their deadliest ability is painting priority targets
with massed markerlights for heavier T’au units to annihilate.

model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the
attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has
the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

TIDEWALL GUNRIG
These mobile anti-grav gun turrets mount railguns whose hypersonic

droneports are arrayed into full defence networks – floating fortresses
that can reposition at need to funnel and slaughter the foe.
