#T’AU EMPIRE
##ARMY RULE
###MARK THE PREY
If your Army Faction is T'au Empire, each unit from your army with this ability (excluding Battle-shocked units) gains a number of Markerlight tokens up to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a unit with the Mark the Prey: 2 ability would gain 2 Markerlight tokens). It is recommended you place suitable markers next to each unit to denote how many Markerlight tokens it has.

Each time a unit from your army with this rule selects targets to shoot you may have any number of other units from your army with this rule contribute Markerlight tokens to Guide the shooting unit against a single one of its targets. If you do, until that shooting is resolved, the contributing units are Observers, the shooting unit is Guided, and the target chosen is Marked. Observers that contribute Markerlight tokens are not eligible to shoot for the purposes Mission rules only (e.g. Primary and Secondary Mission cards, and Crusade rules that require a unit to be eligible to shoot).

To contribute Markerlight tokens, an Observer unit must have one or more Markerlight tokens and the Marked unit must be visible to them. If so you may remove any number of Markerlight tokens from each of those Observers, to a minimum of 0. Those Markerlight tokens are now contributed to the Market unit, and the combined total of those contributed Markerlight tokens is the Marked unit's Markerlight token pool. 

The Guided unit can spend Markerlight tokens from the Marked unit's Markerlight token pool to apply Mark the Prey effects. To apply a Mark the Prey effect, subtract its Cost in Markerlight tokens from the Marked unit's Markerlight pool. You may do this once for each Mark the Prey effect. If the Cost of a Mark the Prey effect in Markerlight Tokens exceeds the remaining Markerlight tokens in the Marked unit's Markerlight Pool, it cannot be applied. 

Mark the Prey effects only apply to the Guided unit and Marked unit, and only while the Guided unit is resolving attacks against the Marked unit. Once the Guided unit has finished resolving its attacks against the Marked unit they cease being the Guided unit and Marked unit for those effects.

####Mark the Prey Effects

#####Strip Cover
Cost: 1 Markerlight Token
The Marked unit loses and cannot gain the benefits of cover against the Guided unit's attacks.

#####Fire for Suppression
Cost: 2 Markerlight Tokens
Just after the Guided unit finishes its ranged attacks against the Marked unit, if one or more of those attacks scored a Hit, the Marked unit must take a Battle Shock test. If the Marked unit suffered one or more unsaved wounds from those attacks, subtract 1 from the roll for that Battle Shock test as well.

#####Precision Telemetry
Cost: 2 or 3 Markerlight Tokens
Increase the Ballistics skill by 1 for the Guided unit's ranged weapons when making attacks against the Marked unit. 
If 3 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark the Prey effect, the Marked unit loses and cannot gain the benefits of Stealth against the Guided unit's attacks as well.

#####Fusillade
Cost: 2 or 4 Markerlight Tokens
Each time the Guided unit makes a ranged attack against the Marked unit, it may re-roll a hit roll of 1.
If 4 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark the Prey effect, the Guided unit's ranged weapons gain [SUSTAINED HITS 1] when making attacks against the Marked unit as well. 

#####Structural Analysis
Cost: 2 or 4 Markerlight Tokens
Each time the Guided unit makes a ranged attack against the Marked unit, it may re-roll a wound roll of 1.
If 4 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark the Prey effect, the Guided unit's ranged weapons gain [LETHAL HITS] when making attacks against the Marked unit as well

#####Target Priority Override
Cost: 3 or 5 Markerlight Tokens
The Guided unit's ranged attacks hit on unmodified Hit rolls of 4+ during Overwatch against the Marked unit.
If 5 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark the Prey effect, the Guided unit's ranged weapons gain [PISTOL] until it finishes its attacks against the Marked unit as well.


##T’AU EMPIRE – PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
###DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, you can use this PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule.

####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
At the start of the first battle round, before the start of the first player turn, you may select up to 3 units from your army and redeploy them. When doing so those units can be placed into Strategic Reserve, ignoring normal limitations. 

Reserves units from your army cannot be destroyed while they are in reserves until the end of the fifth Battle Round. Beginning from the fourth Battle Round, reserves units from your army that are set up wholly within 6" of a battlefield edge ignore the normal restrictions on how close they may be set up to enemy units, and can be set up wholly outside of 3" from enemy units instead. 

Units from your army that are on the battlefield at the beginning of the first Battle Round gain Scouts 6" and their weapons gain the [ASSAULT] ability until the end of the first turn in which you deploy a reserves unit.


##T’AU EMPIRE – PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
###STRATAGEMS
If you are using the PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule, you can use these PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Stratagems.

####KILLING BLOW - 1CP
#####PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
WHEN: The start of your Movement phase

##T'AU EMPIRE - PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
### ENHANCEMENTS
If you are using the PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule, you can use these PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Enhancements.

####EXEMPLAR OF THE KAUYON
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
At the end of each of your opponent's turns, if the bearer's unit is wholly within 9" of a battlefield edge you may place it into Strategic Reserve. You may only do this once per battlefield edge.

####EXEMPLAR OF THE MONT'KA
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
Add 1 to the OC of models in the bearer's unit until the end of your next Command phase whenever the bearer ends an Advance move in range of an Objective that one or more enemy units is also in range of. 

####PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
Each time you would use a Stratagem that targets one or more units within 6" of the bearer, roll a D6. On a result of 4+ you may subtract 1 from that Stratagem's CP cost to a minimum of 0.

####PRECISION OF THE PATIENT HUNTER
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper models). 
The bearer's weapons gain Precision. If any of the bearer's weapons already had Precision, attacks with those weapons gain +1 to Hit rolls and +1 to Wound rolls against Character units.

##T’AU EMPIRE

GHOSTKEEL BATTLESUIT
Nothing so huge should be able to slip unnoticed across the
battlefield, yet between its stealth field and its electronic warfare
suite the Ghostkeel Battlesuit does just that. Once in position its pilot
unleashes ferocious volleys of firepower, ambushing, overwhelming
and scattering the terrified foe in a matter of moments.

Hidden behind shimmering stealth fields, the Firesight Marksmen
play their targeting instruments over the foe and transmit data to the
MV71 Sniper Drones in their thrall. In this way they augment the fireprioritisation routines of the drones’ artificial intelligences, rendering
them smarter, more cunning and even more deadly to distant foes.

drones can optimise the team’s pulse fire or drive the enemy back with
gravitic waves. Yet their deadliest ability is painting priority targets
with massed markerlights for heavier T’au units to annihilate.

■ Models in that unit do not need to take Desperate Escape
tests due to Falling Back while Battle-shocked, except for
those that will move over enemy models when doing so.

model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the
attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has
the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

TIDEWALL GUNRIG
These mobile anti-grav gun turrets mount railguns whose hypersonic
rounds can stop even super-heavy war engines dead in their tracks.
They form deadly fire points around which Tidewall Shieldlines and
droneports are arrayed into full defence networks – floating fortresses
that can reposition at need to funnel and slaughter the foe.
