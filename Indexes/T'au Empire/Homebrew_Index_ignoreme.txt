T’AU EMPIRE
ARMY RULE
MARK THE PREY
If your Army Faction is T'au Empire, at the start of your Shooting phase, each unit from your army with this ability (excluding Battle-shocked units) generates a number of Markerlight tokens equal to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a unit with the Mark the Prey 2 ability would generate 2 Markerlight tokens). 
These Markerlight tokens can be contributed by the unit that generated them. It is recommended you place a suitable marker next to each unit with Markerlight Tokens to denote how many they have available. 

At any point during the battle round, friendly units with this rule can contribute any of their remaining Markerlight tokens to any or all units they can see by deducting the contributed Markerlight tokens from their remaining Markerlight tokens.

The sum of these contributed Markerlight tokens contributed to any unit becomes that unit's Markerlight Pool.

All Markerlight Tokens are removed at the start of your Shooting phase, before new ones are generated.

When a unit with this rule selects a target with one or more Markerlight Tokens in its Markerlight Pool it can select any number of Mark Targets effects, one at a time, to apply to that target. 
If it does so, it becomes the Guided unit and the target becomes the Marked unit for the purposes of those Mark Targets effects.
If the Cost of the Mark Targets effect in Markerlight Tokens exceeds the Marked unit's Markerlight Pool, that Mark Targets effect cannot be chosen by the Guided unit. 
Each time the Guided unit selects a Mark Targets effect, it subtracts the Cost in Markerlight tokens for that effect from that Marked unit's Markerlight pool. 

Mark Targets effects apply while the Guided unit is shooting the Marked unit. Once the Guided unit has finished shooting against the Marked unit, they cease being the Guided unit and Marked unit.

Strip Cover
Cost: 1 Markerlight Token
The Marked unit loses and cannot gain the benefits of cover against the Guided unit's ranged attacks.

Fire for Suppression
Cost: 1 Markerlight Tokens
If the Guided unit scores one or more hits against the Marked unit, the Marked unit must take a Battle Shock test. 
If the Guided unit scores one or more unsaved wounds against the Marked unit, subtract 1 from the roll for that Battle Shock test.

Precision Telemetry
Cost: 1 or 3 Markerlight Tokens
Increase the Ballistics skill by 1 for the Guided unit's ranged weapons against the Marked unit. 
If 3 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark Targets effect, the Guided unit may also ignore any or all modifiers to hit for its ranged attacks against the Marked Target.

Coordinated Onslaught
Cost: 2 or 4 Markerlight Tokens
The Guided unit's ranged weapons gain Sustained Hits 1 against the Marked unit. 
If 4 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark Targets effect, each time the Guided unit makes a ranged attack against the Marked unit, it may re-roll the hit roll.
//(CM): Unsure if to make this SH2 instead

Structural Analysis
Cost: 2 or 4 Markerlight Tokens
The Guided unit's ranged weapons gain Lethal Hits against the Marked Target. 
If 4 Markerlight Tokens were spent for this Mark Targets effect, each time the Guided unit makes a ranged attack against the Marked unit, it may re-roll the wound roll.
//(CM): Unsure if to make this ? double lethal ? instead

T’AU EMPIRE – PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, you can use this PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR Detachment rule.

PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
At the start of the first battle round, before the start of the first player turn, you may select up to 3 units from your army and redeploy them. When doing so, those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves, regardless of how
many units are already in Strategic Reserves.

Strategic Reserves units from your army may be set up wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge including your opponent's when they are deployed, and may be set up from Strategic Reserves in your opponent's deployment zone. 

If a unit from your army is deployed wholly within 6" of a battlefield edge, it may also be set up wholly outside of 3" of your opponent's units instead of any other restrictions on distance from enemy units.

Units from your army that are on the battlefield and that were not redeployed gain Scouts 6" and their ranged weapons gain Assault for the duration of the first and second Battle Rounds.

EXEMPLAR OF THE PHILOSOPHIES OF WAR
Long meditation upon the tenets of the Patient Hunter
has seen this warrior master the application of this
cunning ambush strategy. When they take to the
battlefield, they embody the teachings of the Kauyon,
much to the dismay of their luckless prey.
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper
models). While the bearer is leading a unit, that unit’s
Kauyon Detachment rule takes effect from the second
battle round onwards instead of the third.
PRECISION OF THE PATIENT HUNTER
This warrior prowls the battlefield like a high-tech
predator, stalking and assessing their quarry before
they strike. When they do launch their assault,
their every shot and blow is informed by careful
observations, perfectly aimed where they will do the
greatest harm.
T’au Empire model only. Each time the bearer makes
a ranged attack, add 1 to the Hit roll. From the third
battle round onwards, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.
PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP
Commander Puretide was undoubtedly the most
gifted T’au war leader of all time. The T’au were
unwilling to lose his tactical and strategic brilliance,
and upon his death, his mind was scanned and his
accumulated memories committed to a holostorage
personality unit on his birth world of Dal’yth. A sliver
of that genius has been crafted into a neurochip.
When surgically implanted into the brain of a Fire
Caste Commander, the bearer can access much of
the wisdom of Puretide himself, drawing upon a great
reservoir of tactical acumen.
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper
models). Once per turn, you can use a Stratagem on
the bearer’s unit, even if you have already used that
Stratagem on a different unit this phase.
THROUGH UNITY, DEVASTATION
Having studied every nuance of the art of applied
mass-firepower, this warrior has mastered its
deployment. Under their calm tutelage and stern
gaze, warriors of the Fire Caste maximise every shot
they fire, creating a blizzard of deadly-accurate
energy that can pick apart even the most heavily
armoured targets.
T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper
models). While this model is leading a unit, each
time that unit is an Observer unit, until the end of
the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in
their Guided unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability while
targeting their Spotted unit.

KROOT FARSTALKERS
